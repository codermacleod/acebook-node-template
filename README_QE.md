## README_QE

# Hi!
Here you will find anything from the QE team that
is worth checking from time to time. 
We will update this in-line with the project.

We were able to implement Cypress and Jest tests to run with github actions upon pushing code to the repo.
When you push code to the repo, click on the ['Actions'](https://github.com/codermacleod/teamFunk/actions) tab to see which tests are being carried out in real time.

To find out more about how github actions work, please visit [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
